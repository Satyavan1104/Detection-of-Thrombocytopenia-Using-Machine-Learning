# Detection of Thrombocytopenia Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
Thrombocytopenia is a medical condition characterized by an abnormally low platelet count, which can lead to serious health complications if not detected early.  
This project focuses on building a **machine learning–based system** to detect thrombocytopenia by analyzing patient clinical data and blood parameters, enabling **early diagnosis and improved clinical decision-making**.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect thrombocytopenia using patient blood test and clinical data  
- Improve early identification of low platelet count conditions  
- Apply machine learning techniques for accurate prediction  
- Visualize results to enhance model understanding and reliability  

## 📊 Methodology
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values  
   - Data cleaning and normalization  
   - Feature selection  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualization of blood parameters  
   - Identification of patterns related to platelet count  

3. **Model Development**
   - Machine learning model training using Scikit-learn  
   - Selection of suitable classification algorithms  

4. **Model Evaluation**
